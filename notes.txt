when a button is selected
  change it to disabled, add appropriate player's symbol, change styling
  

player1 - blue, X
player2 - red, O


I need a data structure that can track the game state, then apply styling based on that
  whenever the turn changes, need to switch "unselected" stylings 

need a variable to track playerTurn

each "button" can have three states:
  player1 owned
  player2 owned
  unowned

after each turn, evaluate to see whether either player has won.
8 possible victory conditions:
  a1,a2,a3
  b1,b2,b3
  c1,c2,c3
  a1,b1,c1
  a2,b2,c2
  a3,b3,c3
  a1,b2,c3
  a3,b2,c1

if all squares are claimed and no winner, then declare a draw


have a reset/restart button
